Firstly, I create a folder and put all the .py file and example.input together. The .py files share some same functions. So please put them together. Also I think my code could handle multiple solutions.

readinput.py: code to read in input and convert them to list

dist.py: code to compute distance between two points

brute.py, full_bf.py, bruteforce.py: code to implement brute force algorithm, to run it, in terminal, use “python3.5 bruteforce.py example.input”, the output_bf.txt file will be created in the folder.

dnc.py, full_dnc.py, divideandconquer.py: code to implement naive divide and conquer algorithm, to run it, in terminal, use ”python3.5 divideandconquer.py example.input”, the output_dnc.txt file will be created in the folder.

edc.py, full_edc.py, enhanceddnc.py: code to implement enhanced divide and conquer algorithm, to run it, in terminal, use “python3.5 enhanceddnc.py example.input”, the output_edc.txt file will be created in the folder.

inputgenerate.py, time.py: code to analyze implementation time
